		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I'm a business professional, living in Seattle and Santa Clara (Silicon Valley). I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I am very curious about how to create an appealing website with codes and graphics. This is my first time to learn how to code, and I desire to acquire at least one or two programming skills, at least to better understand how my colleagues in product team work :)  For my career passion, I hope to develop further in the visual art field, and therefore, I will focus more on graphic design in the next stage.</p>

		<h2>My Mission</h2>
		<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to create my own website, and help my company to improve website.</p>
